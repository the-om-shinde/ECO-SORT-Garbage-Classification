# Real-Time Waste Detection and Classification Using YOLO12-Based Deep Learning Model

##  Key Features

###  Real-time Detection
High-speed object detection using **YOLO12**, optimized for low latency inference.

###   Garbage Classification & Safety Monitoring SystemDual Mode GUI (customtkinter)

- **Static Image Analysis**
  - Upload and analyze images
  - Display bounding boxes with confidence scores

- **Live Camera Mode**
  - Real-time detection via webcam
  - Continuous frame-by-frame classification

###  Advanced Camera Analytics

- **Hazardous Waste Alert**
  - Detects batteries
  - Triggers visual red alert overlay (fire hazard prevention)

- **Safety Zones**
  - Uses scan ratios
  - Valid region filtering to remove background noise

- **Intelligent Tracking**
  - Powered by ByteTrack
  - Maintains consistent object IDs across frames

###  Modern UI
- Dark theme interface
- System status indicators
- Detection result history panel

##  Supported Categories

The model is trained to recognize **10 classes**:

| Class ID | Category | Type |
|----------|----------|------|
| 0 | Battery | Hazardous |
| 1 | Biological | Organic Waste |
| 2 | Cardboard | Recyclable |
| 3 | Clothes | Recyclable |
| 4 | Glass | Recyclable |
| 5 | Metal | Recyclable |
| 6 | Paper | Recyclable |
| 7 | Plastic | Recyclable |
| 8 | Shoes | Recyclable |
| 9 | Trash | Non-recyclable |

##  Technical Details

###  Model

- Architecture: YOLO12
- Weights location:
  ```
  garbage_project/train_run/weights/best.pt
  ```

###  Confidence Thresholds

| Mode | Threshold |
|------|----------|
| GUI Detection | 0.4 – 0.5 |
| Video Tracking | 0.05 |
| High-Confidence Lock | 0.70 |

##  Performance Notes

- GPU acceleration significantly improves FPS
- CPU-only mode works but reduces throughput
- Tracking mode requires lower confidence threshold for stability

---

##  Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

- Web-based dashboard (FastAPI + React)
- Cloud deployment
- Auto dataset augmentation
- Multi-camera monitoring
- Firebase alert integration
